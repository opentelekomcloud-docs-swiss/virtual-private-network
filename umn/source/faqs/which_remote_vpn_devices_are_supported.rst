Other devices that meet the requirements in the reference protocols described in section :ref:`Reference Standards and Protocols <vpn_01_0006>` can also be deployed. However, some devices may fail to add because of inconsistent protocol implementation methods of these devices. If the connection setup fails, rectify the fault by following the instructions provided in section :ref:`What Do I Do If VPN Setup Fails? <vpn_07_0003>` or contact customer service.
