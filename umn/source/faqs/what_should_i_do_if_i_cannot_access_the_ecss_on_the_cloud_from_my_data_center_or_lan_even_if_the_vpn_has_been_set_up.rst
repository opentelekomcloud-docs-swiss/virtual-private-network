What Should I Do If I Cannot Access the ECSs on the Cloud from My Data Center or LAN Even If the VPN Has Been Set Up?
=====================================================================================================================

The security group denies the access from all sources by default. If you want to access your ECSs, modify the security group configuration and allow the access from the remote subnets.
